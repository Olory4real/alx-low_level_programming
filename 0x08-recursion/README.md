## C - Recursion

#### [0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget](0-puts_recursion.c)

Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);

#### [1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together](1-print_rev_recursion.c)

Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

- Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);

#### [2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange](2-strlen_recursion.c)

Write a function that returns the length of a string.

- Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);

#### [3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling](3-factorial.c)

Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

- Prototype: int factorial(int n);
- If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
- Factorial of 0 is 1

#### [4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate](4-pow_recursion.c)

Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
